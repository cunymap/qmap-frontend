# Git Notes
## Branch + Merge
- **Create Branch:** "git checkout ____" creates subbranch from current head
- I am calling the sub-branch's origin branch parent. It could be called master, feature/..., releases, etc
- Parent branches shouldn't be tweaked while work is being done in subbranch
- **Merge Branch:** "git checkout" to parent branch. And then "git Merge" with the branch you currently working on. This merges the working branch with the parent branch. Afterwards checkout to working branch and merge with parent. The order is important.
- In the network graphics, working branches should be ahead of main branch before any merging. After merging, all tags should align with parent branch being a straight line all along branching process.
- In between each stage of merge/checkouts make sure to git pull.
- Also, do the merges from child's editor's computer for iOS projects. This gives us an option to 86 that branch without having to redo the project if there are any serious .plist / pod / XML merge conflicts.


## Local to Global first-time setup
- git config --list (checks current git account)
- git config -- global user.name " "
- git config -- global user.email " "
- some others pre-reqs: SSH for alternate to https and GPG keys for verified git commits
- git init
- echo "#repo-name" > README.md
- git commit -am" "
- create the git repo online WITHOUT a README. Then copy the code from the section that reads: **"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**
- git push (-u origin master)
